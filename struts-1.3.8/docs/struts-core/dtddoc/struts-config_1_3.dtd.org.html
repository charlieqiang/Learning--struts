&lt;!-- ========== Defined Types ============================================= -->


&lt;!-- An "AttributeName" is the identifier of a page, request, session, or
     application scope attribute.
-->
&lt;!ENTITY % AttributeName "CDATA">


&lt;!-- A "BeanName" is the identifier of a JavaBean, such as a form bean,
     and also serves as the name of the corresponding scripting variable
     and the name of the JSP attribute under which the bean is accessed.
     Therefore, it must conform to the rules for a Java identifier.
-->
&lt;!ENTITY % BeanName "CDATA">


&lt;!-- A "Boolean" is the string representation of a boolean (true or false)
     variable.
-->
&lt;!ENTITY % Boolean "(true|false|yes|no)">

     instantiated to provide the functionality of the enclosing element.
-->
&lt;!ENTITY % ClassName "CDATA">


&lt;!-- An "Integer" is a character string consisting solely of numeric digits,
     optionally preceeded by a minus sign, that can be converted to a
     32-bit integer.
-->
&lt;!ENTITY % Integer "CDATA">


&lt;!-- A "Location" is a relative path, delimited by "/" characters, that
     defines the location of a resource relative to the location of the
     Struts configuration file itself.
-->
&lt;!ENTITY % Location "#PCDATA">


&lt;!-- A "PropName" is the name of a JavaBeans property, and must begin with
     a lower case letter and contain only characters that are legal in a
     Java identifier.

&lt;!-- The "form-property" element describes a JavaBean property that can be used to
     configure an instance of a DynaActionForm or a subclass thereof. This element
     is only utilized when the "type" attribute of the enclosing "form-bean" element
     is [org.apache.struts.action.DynaActionForm] or a subclass of DynaActionForm. If
     a custom DynaActionForm subclass is used, then the "dynamic" attribute of the
     enclosing &lt;form-bean> element must be set to "true". Since Struts 1.1.

     name            The name of the JavaBean property described by this element.

     reset           The flag that indicates when this property should be reset 
                     to its "initial" value when the form's "reset()" method is 
                     called.  If this is set to "true", the property is always 
                     reset when "reset()" is called.  This can also be set to 
                     one or more HTTP methods, such as GET or POST. In such a 
                     case, the property will be reset only when the HTTP method 
                     used for the request being processed is included in this 
                     attribute's value(s).  Multiple HTTP methods can be

                     which control should be returned if a validation error is
                     encountered. Valid only when "name" is specified. Required
                     if "name" is specified and the input bean returns
                     validation errors. Optional if "name" is specified and the
                     input bean does not return validation errors.

     name            Name of the form bean, if any, that is associated with this
                     action mapping.

     parameter       General-purpose configuration parameter that can be used to
                     pass extra information to the Action object selected by
                     this action mapping.

     path            The module-relative path of the submitted request, starting
                     with a "/" character, and without the filename extension if
                     extension mapping is used.

                     NOTE:  Do *not* include a period in your path name,
                     because it will look like a filename extension and
                     cause your Action to not be located.

     prefix          Prefix used to match request parameter names to ActionForm
                     property names, if any. Optional if "name" is specified,
                     else not allowed.

     roles           Comma-delimited list of security role names that are allowed
                     access to this ActionMapping object. Since Struts 1.1.

     scope           The context ("request" or "session") that is used to
                     access our ActionForm bean, if any.  Optional if "name" is
                     specified, else not valid. [session]

     suffix          Suffix used to match request parameter names to ActionForm
                     bean property names, if any. Optional if "name" is
                     specified, else not valid.

     type            Fully qualified Java class name of the Action subclass
                     [org.apache.struts.action.Action] that will process requests
                     for this action mapping. Not valid if either the "forward"
                     or "include" attribute is specified.  Exactly one of
                     "forward", "include", or "type" must be specified.

     unknown         Set to "true" if this object should be configured as the
                     default action mapping for this module. If a request does not
                     match another object, it will be passed to the ActionMapping
                     object with unknown set to "true". Only one ActionMapping
                     can be marked as "unknown" within a module.
                     [false]

     validate        Set to "true" if the validate method of the ActionForm bean
                     should be called prior to calling the Action object for this
                     action mapping, or set to "false" if you do not want the
                     validate method called.

&lt;!-- The "controller" element describes the ControllerConfig bean
     [org.apache.struts.config.ControllerConfig] that encapsulates
     a module's runtime configuration. The following
     attributes are defined:

     bufferSize      The size of the input buffer used when processing
                     file uploads.
                     [4096]

     contentType     Default content type (and optional character encoding) to
                     be set on each response. May be overridden by the Action,
                     JSP, or other resource to which the request is forwarded.
                     ["text/html"]

     forwardPattern  Replacement pattern defining how the "path" attribute of a
                     &lt;forward> element is mapped to a context-relative URL when
                     it starts with a slash (and when the contextRelative
                     property is false). This value may consist of any
                     combination of the following:
                     - "$M" - Replaced by the module prefix of this module

                     Silently swallowed, reserved for future use
                     If not specified, the default forwardPattern is "$M$P",

                     forwards.  Since Struts 1.1.  ["$M$P"]

     inputForward    Set to "true" if you want the "input" attribute of
                     &lt;action> elements to be the name of a local or global
                     ActionForward, which will then be used to calculate the
                     ultimate URL. Set to "false" (the default) to treat the
                     "input" parameter of &lt;action> elements as a
                     module-relative path to the resource
                     to be used as the input form. Since Struts 1.1.

     maxFileSize     The maximum size (in bytes) of a file to be accepted as a
                     file upload.  Can be expressed as a number followed by a
                     "K", "M", or "G", which are interpreted to mean kilobytes,
                     megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively.
                     ["250M"]

     memFileSize     The maximum size (in bytes) of a file whose contents will
                     be retained in memory after uploading. Files larger than
                     this threshold will be written to some alternative storage
                     medium, typically a hard disk. Can be expressed as a number
                     followed by a "K", "M", or "G", which are interpreted to
                     mean kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively.
                     ["256K"]

     multipartClass  The fully qualified Java class name of the multipart
                     request handler class to be used with this module.
                     ["org.apache.struts.upload.CommonsMultipartRequestHandler"]

     nocache         Set to "true" if you want the controller to add HTTP
                     headers for defeating caching to every response from
                     this module.  [false]

     pagePattern     Replacement pattern defining how the "page" attribute of
                     custom tags using it is mapped to a context-relative URL
                     of the corresponding resource.  This value may consist of
                     any combination of the following:
                     - "$M" - Replaced by the module prefix of this module
                     - "$P" - Replaced by the value of the "page" attribute

                              Silently swallowed, reserved for future use
                     If not specified, the default forwardPattern is
                     "$M$P", which is consistent with previous hard coded
                     behavior of URL evaluation for "page" attributes.

     key             Servlet context attribute under which this message
                     resources bundle will be stored. The default attribute is
                     the value specified by the string constant at
                     [Globals.MESSAGES_KEY]. The module prefix (if

                     NOTE: The module  prefix includes the leading
                     slash, so the default message resource bundle for a module

&lt;!-- ========== Subordinate Elements ====================================== -->


&lt;!-- The "description" element contains descriptive (paragraph length) text
     about the surrounding element, suitable for use in GUI tools.

     specify the location, relative to the Struts configuration file, for small
     and large images used to represent the surrounding element in GUI tools.
-->

&lt;!ELEMENT large-icon     (%Location;)>
&lt;!ATTLIST large-icon     id             ID              #IMPLIED>


&lt;!-- The "set-property" element specifies the method name and initial value of
     an additional JavaBean configuration property. When the object representing
     the surrounding element is instantiated, the accessor for the indicated
     property is called and passed the indicated value. The "set-property"
     element is especially useful when a custom subclass is used with
     &lt;forward>, &lt;action>, or &lt;plug-in> elements. The subclass
     can be passed whatever other properties may be required to configure the
     object without changing how the struts-config is parsed.

    Since Struts 1.3, an alternate syntax is supported.  By using
    the "key" attribute instead of the "property" attribute, you can set 
    arbitrary string properties on the Config object which is populated
    based on the containing element.   NOTE: the "key" attribute is NOT
	supported for &lt;set-property> inside a &lt;plug-in> element.

     property        Name of the JavaBeans property whose setter method
                     will be called. Exactly one of
                     "property" or "key" must be specified.

     key             Where supported, the key which will be used to store
                     the specified value in the given config object.  Exactly one of
                     "property" or "key" must be specified.

     value           String representation of the value to which this
                     property will be set, after suitable type conversion
